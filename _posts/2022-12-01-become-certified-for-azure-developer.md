Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Are you interested in becoming a certified Azure Developer Associate? Well, you're in luck because in this blog post, I'm going to share my personal journey and tips on how to pass the AZ 204 and AZ 900 exams.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Why should I even bother getting certified? Well, it's simple. Experience is great, but having a certification shows employers and colleagues that you have the knowledge and skills to back it up. Plus, who doesn't love adding a shiny new badge to their collection? ðŸ˜‰

To be honest, I was like you before. I never really thought about getting certified until I learned more about it and its benefits. But now, I'm hooked on continuous learning and development with new technologies. And that's why I decided to challenge myself and become a Microsoft Certified Azure Developer Associate.

But let me tell you, passing the AZ 204 exam was no walk in the park. It's a tough exam designed for experienced developers and cloud engineers. The exam has a random selection of 40-60 questions in different formats, including use-case scenarios, programming codes, and true/false questions. And the passing score is 700 out of 1000, so you better be ready!

But don't worry, I've got your back. Preparation is key, and I have a list of resources to help you study and ace the exam. Plus, if you're not quite ready for the AZ 204 exam, you can start with the AZ 900 Azure Fundamentals exam. It doesn't require any programming skills, but you'll need to know the basics of cloud computing and Microsoft Azure platform.

If you're getting ready for the AZ 900 Azure Fundamentals exam, I highly recommend checking out [the Microsoft Learn Azure Fundamentals Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900/) and [AZ-900 cheatsheet](https://marczak.io/az-900/episode-01/cheat-sheet/) These resources will help you get a good grasp of the cloud computing basics and working in the Microsoft Azure platform.

But when it comes to the AZ 204 Azure Developer Associate exam, things get a bit more challenging. You'll need to invest more time and effort, not only to learn the Azure Development concepts covered in the exam's skill list but also to know how to put them into practice. The exam is focused on how you can apply your knowledge to solve problems and create solutions using Microsoft Azure services. That's why it's crucial to prepare well and practice solving cloud-related use case scenarios as a software or cloud engineer.

Don't underestimate the importance of preparation. Taking the exam without sufficient preparation puts you at risk of failing. So make sure you're ready to ace the exam before you take it!
