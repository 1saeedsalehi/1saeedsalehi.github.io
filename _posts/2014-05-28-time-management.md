# A Simple Tool to Help You Manage Your Time  

Do you often lose track of time when working on your computer? I do. Once I sit down, I completely forget about the clock.  

That’s why I started using RescueTime. It’s a small tool that tracks how you spend your time on your computer. It shows you which apps and websites you use and analyzes how much time you spend on each.  

Here’s how it works:  
- It gives **positive ratings** for productive tools like **Visual Studio**, **Notepad++**, or websites like **Stack Overflow**.  
- It gives **negative ratings** for distractions like social media or checking email during work hours.  

You can customize these ratings in your RescueTime dashboard to fit your goals. Every week, it sends you a report showing how productive you were and how much time you spent on distractions.  

For me, these reports have been a wake-up call. They’ve helped me cut down on time-wasting activities and focus more on getting work done.  

If you want to try it, you can download RescueTime here: [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).  

Give it a shot—it’s a game-changer!
