### Hello World!

As you can see in my earlier blog post was written in Persian. most of the readers were located in Iran and that's why It was Persian.

After immigrating to the Netherlands, I assumed that it was better to write my posts in English to be able to share them with new people.

I decided to let the older post remain in the Persian
maybe translate them to English when I have free time
