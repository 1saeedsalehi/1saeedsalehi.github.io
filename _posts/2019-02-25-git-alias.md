If you are absent-minded (like me) and forget the long but widely used `git` commands

I want to tell you a simple but useful solution
May you be saved
Imagine the following command
‍‍‍‍‍‍‍`
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
`

It is supposed to give you a complete log of undone commits
Similar to what you can see in Git GUIs

  ***Please note that this order itself is not the subject of our discussion***

Well, instead of saving this command with all its parameters,you can define an alias for it which acts like a shortcut

‍
`
git config --global alias.havij "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
`

Well, it's enough to hit from now on

`
git havij
`

and that's it
