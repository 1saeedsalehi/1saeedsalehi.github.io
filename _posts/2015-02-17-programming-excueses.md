Hey 
here I find some funny excuses that **every programmer** used at least once :)

- That worked perfectly when I developed it
- Everything looks fine my end
- That's not a bug it's a configuration issue
- It must be because of a leap year
- Actually, that's a feature
- That feature would be outside of the scope
- It's just some unlucky coincidence
- I thought I finished that
