Hi, I’m Saeed! I believe sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we make helps others and saves time for everyone working on similar projects. That’s why I’m here! 🤘

🧑‍💻 I’ve loved computers since the Y2K days 🪲, and I’m still amazed by what we can create with them.

💬 Feel free to chat with me about software engineering or anything else!
